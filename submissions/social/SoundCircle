# SoundCircle

SoundCircle is a decentralized community board built on top of Soundness, where users can create small interest-based groups and share updates securely.

## Why this project?
Communities online are usually hosted on centralized platforms that can ban or censor groups anytime. SoundCircle provides a censorship-resistant alternative, ensuring every post and membership is verifiable through Soundness proofs.

## Key Features
- 🏘 **Community boards** – Users can create or join topic-based circles.  
- 🔑 **Proof-based membership** – Each member is verified through Soundness, preventing fake accounts.  
- 📢 **Immutable announcements** – Posts are permanently verifiable and cannot be altered retroactively.  
- 🛡 **Privacy control** – Users can choose between public or members-only posts.  

## Roadmap
1. Build group creation and membership verification.  
2. Enable post submission + retrieval linked to Soundness proofs.  
3. Add privacy toggle (public / private).  
4. Develop a minimal UI for browsing groups.  

## Next Steps
- Submit vApp to Soundness cockpit.  
- Collect early feedback.  
- Expand features like reactions, comments, and moderation tools.
